                <h2>Tom Yum Goong</h2>
                <p>Galangal, a root similar to ginger, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, and fish sauce give this soup
                    authentic flavor. Substitute ginger if you can't find galangal, and use 3 (2-inch) lime rind strips
                    in
                    place of the leaves. Reserve the shrimp shells; you'll need them to make the broth. Serve with rice
                    noodles, if desired.</p>

                <h2>Dim Sum</h2>
                <p>Dim sum is a traditional Chinese meal made up of small plates of dumplings and other snack dishes and
                    is
                    usually accompanied by tea. Similar to the way that the Spanish eat tapas, the dishes are shared
                    among
                    family and friends. Typically dim sum is consumed during brunch hours — late morning to lunchtime.
